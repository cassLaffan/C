They tell this of Julius Caesar,
That he put some ice in a freezer,
Observing to Brutus,
"We'll chill it to suit us!'
Now, he was a funny old geezer. 

There once was a girl named Miranda
Who flirted with one Ferdinand, a
Shipwrecked young prince
Who, after a rinse
Played chess with her on the veranda.

There was a fat man they called Falstaff:
When he walked he carried a tall staff
And this made him lean —
That is — I mean —
It made him lean on the tall staff.
